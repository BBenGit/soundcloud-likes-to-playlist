## Moves tracks from "Liked" to a "Playlist" in order to make the playlist downloadable

1. go to https://soundcloud.com/you/likes
2. create new playlist
 - make sure *only* one playlist exists
 - make sure nothing is added to it
 - copy the playlist link
3. go back to page from 1-st step & make sure all songs are displayed (aka scroll down untill nothing more loads, you can use "end" keyboard button for that)
4. in browser console this script: https://github.com/ashwalk33r/soundcloud-likes-to-playlist/blob/master/run-on-likes-page.js
